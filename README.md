# NesTiler
Tool for converting pictures into NES format: pattern tables, nametables, attribute tables and palettes.

# What does it do
When developing applications and games for NES, to display images, you need to split each image into tiles, combine tiles into nametables, select colors so that they do not go beyond the limits of the NES, and then convert all this into a format understandable for the NES. This tool at least partly helps to automate this process.
